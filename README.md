# Mesh_Modelisation

## Initialization

In order to use these files, you have to install [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download) on your computer. 

Personnally, I got the *MSVC-2019* compiler but normally, you can get other one.

Tu run the project, juste open [Mesh_Computational_Geometry.pro](/Mesh_Computational_Geometry/Mesh_Computational_Geometry.pro), then compile (CTRL+b) and execute (CTRL+r) the project.

## Usage

This work come from a BE at Ecole Centrale de Lyon. We worked on the 3D modelisation thanks to triangulated mesh.

In this example, you have a graphical interface where you have both options :

![Graphical interface](/Picture/Graphical_interface.png)


- First you got a simple pyramid mesh. (you can check or not the wireframe)

- By chossing a number and click on "Maillage" you gonna to turn around a vertex of the mesh. All the faces associated to this vertex will be painted in red.

- By clicking on "Import un mesh", you can import a mesh. (Please be sure it's in .off format)

- By clicking on "Sauver un mesh", you can save your mesh under .off format.

- By clicking on "Couleur", you will change the displaying color of the mesh.

Finally, if you want to quit the application, please push the button "Quitter".

Thanks,
